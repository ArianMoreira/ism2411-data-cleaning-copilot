What Copilot Did

I used GitHub Copilot to help write some functions in data_cleaning.py, like load_data and clean_column_names. I gave it comments about what I wanted, and it suggested code I could use.

What I Changed

I made a few changes to make it work with my data. I added steps to convert price and qty to numbers, remove negative values, and handle missing data. I also cleaned up the column names so they matched the CSV.

What I Learned

Copilot is helpful for getting code started, but I still needed to check and fix things. I got better at using pandas and handling messy data. It’s a good tool, but it can’t replace thinking through the problem.
