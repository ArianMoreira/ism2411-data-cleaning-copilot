This is a small Python project that cleans up a messy sales dataset. It fixes messy column names, removes extra spaces, converts numbers properly, and drops invalid rows like negative quantities or prices. The result is a clean CSV ready for analysis.

How to Run

Make sure Python is installed

Install pandas if you don't have it

Run the script from the project root:
python src/data_cleaning.py

The cleaned CSV will be saved to data/processed/sales_data_clean.csv.
The script will also print a quick preview of the cleaned data in the terminal.
